								<h2>She</h2>
								<p>Shifts? <br />
									As I ponder over this word, it takes me back to my various past selves. How I was and what I am in this present. How exactly the changes took place- within me and around me. If I could ever, pen down these changes in mere words? Which eventually shifted my entire existence? <br />
									With the background of enormous shifts and culture rendezvous in mind, the ever so beautiful combination of these words takes me a decade back. <br />
									Ooh, there is this young and naïve past self, happy and rebellious. She is bubbly, sentimental and sensitive – a combination of traits which are a bit rare to find. Respect for emotions is always her top priority. She doesn’t know much about the world or how it works. Her world is simple and sorted. Few friends and family and at times studies. The present is bliss. <br />
									On the edge of Learning new experiences; She is on the rise of her youth. Devastating and Unreachable. <br />
									But which reach could ever be not broken? Isn’t it? The devastations must happen and for good. <br />
									So, this is how the changes begin and consummate – The ever so powerful newness; New people with their new dimensions, unknown ones, varied ones, at times the irrevocable ones.  <br />
									The unknown territory is vast. First comes people, then comes their persona, their character, their morale, their culture, their language – basically they bring in whole new world. Very overwhelming it can be. <br />
									So how does she manage? And still continue to retain her true self? 
									Change is the only constant and this constant is something which stirs and shifts you completely.
									-	<br />
									She breaks with every heartbreak; She loves with whole heart; She continues to shift among people and learns the new ways; She creates- recreates every second; She thinks and measures; She adapts; She acknowledge; She inculcates; <br />
									She changes with the continuous shifts. <br />
									She leaves the previous version of hers and built’ a new one. A new self. An unknown self. Each time and Every time. <br />
									She is on a brand-new journey. She learns every day. <br />
									Because <br />
									She knows now - “To Live means to constantly shift colors”. <br />
									She RISES. <br />
									ALWAYS. <br />

								<h2>Mysticism!</h2>
								<p>Only a mystic can understand another mystic. There is no room for conformism in true mysticism. The process of Soul Evolution is called self-realization, not group thinking, for a reason. Since being an academic is the highest form of conformism, they are furthest away from even remotely understanding mystic thinking and mystic writing..<br />
