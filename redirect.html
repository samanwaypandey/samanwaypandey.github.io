								<p>Everyday my heart falls deeper in the pain of your sorrow.<br />
									Your cruel heart is weary of me already.<br />
									You have left me alone, yet your sorrow remains.<br />

								<h2>She</h2>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">--</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shifts?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I ponder over this word, it takes me back to my various past selves. How I was and what I am in this present. How exactly the changes took place- within me and around me. If I could ever, pen down these changes in mere words? Which eventually shifted my entire existence?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the background of enormous shifts and culture rendezvous in mind, the ever so beautiful combination of these words takes me a decade back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ooh, there is this young and na&iuml;ve past self, happy and rebellious. She is bubbly, sentimental and sensitive &ndash; a combination of traits which are a bit rare to find. Respect for emotions is always her top priority. She doesn&rsquo;t know much about the world or how it works. Her world is simple and sorted. Few friends and family and at times studies. The present is bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the edge of Learning new experiences; She is on the rise of her youth. Devastating and Unreachable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which reach could ever be not broken? Isn&rsquo;t it? The devastations must happen and for good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, this is how the changes begin and consummate &ndash; The ever so powerful newness; New people with their new dimensions, unknown ones, varied ones, at times the irrevocable ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unknown territory is vast. First comes people, then comes their persona, their character, their morale, their culture, their language &ndash; basically they bring in whole new world. Very overwhelming it can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does she manage? And still continue to retain her true self?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Change is the only constant and this constant is something which stirs and shifts you completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">--</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She breaks with every heartbreak; She loves with whole heart; She continues to shift among people and learns the new ways; She creates- recreates every second; She thinks and measures; She adapts; She acknowledge; She inculcates;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She changes with the continuous shifts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She leaves the previous version of hers and built&rsquo; a new one. A new self. An unknown self. Each time and Every time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She is on a brand-new journey. She learns every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She knows now - &ldquo;To Live means to constantly shift colors&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She RISES.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ALWAYS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">--</p>

								<h2>Amusings.!</h2>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Amidst all the chaos surrounding the New Year festivities and celebrations. People focus on momentary happiness&rsquo; and follow the trends of other people &ndash; either from their life or through internet. Its that time of the year when it is all about New year parties, New resolutions, New year vacations, New year and New You; Yada Yada Yada...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its all flashy and monotonous in a way. People have grown blind fools to these New year shenanigans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A revolution is required more than ever; A moment to step back; Analyze; Think and to take an Individualistic Resolve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The concentration on Inner Self, the emphasis of inner peace should be realized and inculcated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We as humans withhold enormous power within us and the Human mind is a place to be. We live most of the times within our Mind Palace and hence it becomes more essential to begin to look into and try making it a better place moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These words might sound religious in nature, but the concept is entirely independent in itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, we are going to talk about a journey &ndash; for a better self; because it is after transforming within one could transform the others around.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s embark on this together: Begin today, right NOW by being AWARE. Notice and acknowledge each word you come across. Notice how you feel? How you act? Which part of your brain it effects? How then later you react? Words and the way you feel about them changes perspectives around you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This practice is called Knowing Self, once you are aware, the next step is Analysis. Think and be decisive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Decide how certain words changes the aspects within you and around you, in short how it affects your mind. The mind can be very tricky, so the idea is to Tame the Mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next step is Thinking. Yes. One must think and make an attempt at self-improvising on daily basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, an independent and self-fulfilling Resolve. The motive is to understand the Self through mind, make the mind in control so that a greater understanding and better relationship with Self can be established and sustained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The complete process is relative in nature. To tame mind is to make it a calmer place than ever. Because we all would like to live in a place that gives us peace, makes us feel calm and relaxed. (it is for this people go on holidays!) Just imagine! if the mind is taken care of &ndash; one could be on a holiday &ndash; EVERYDAY.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A calm mind is a damn good beginning for Self-Growth. So, at this moment I urge all of you to please begin this year with thinking. Give it a thought. Kya he ho jaega?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please do connect back and I shall come up with the next instalment of Awakening. #staytuned #thisisTHEbegining</p>

								<h2>Musings..</h2>
								<p>&ldquo;i want to cover my walls with the sun. the sun rising, the sun falling, the sun setting. the sun sinking, the sun sleeping, the sun smiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i want to hang paintings of the sunrise, the spread of dawn and new beginnings freshly pink, the first colours i see when i awake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i want to hang paintings of the sunset, the mauve of the end of a good day sinking into me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i want to be reminded of the sun, the gold shifting inside of me like sand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i want clouds of pink and blue and violet and soft peach enveloping me until all that is left is dreaminess and an endless sky. this desire to emulate the sun during <strong>transition</strong> is so strong within me that it almost feels like a <strong>curse</strong> flung upon me from the gods. a yearning for soft gold, quiet pastels and the sky&rsquo;s inexplicable blue, it must be wicked to want things that are so soft and sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And</p>
<p>&nbsp;i wonder if it&rsquo;s because i want to paint my own transitions just as beautifully and serenely instead of the roaring, burning beings they are and the bitter taste it stains behind my ears and under my kneecaps.&rdquo;</p>

	<h2>Silence!</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p style='margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: "Helvetica Neue"; text-align: justify;'>And so we stood together like that, at the top of that field for what seemed like ages, not saying anything, just holding each other, while the wind kept blowing and blowing at us, tugging our clothes, and for a moment, it seemed like we were holding onto each other because that was the only way to stop us from being swept away into the night.</p>

								<h2>Mysticism!</h2>
								<p>Only a mystic can understand another mystic. There is no room for conformism in true mysticism. The process of Soul Evolution is called self-realization, not group thinking, for a reason. Since being an academic is the highest form of conformism, they are furthest away from even remotely understanding mystic thinking and mystic writing..<br />
