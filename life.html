<p class="p1">You've got to let your ghosts</p>
<p class="p1">Pummel you to a pulp</p>
<p class="p1">Till there's solely</p>
<p class="p1">The mushy mess of blood,</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flesh, and bone-dust.</p>
<p class="p1">Put it all in the blender</p>
<p class="p1">And you'll notice your teeth still rattle;</p>
<p class="p1">You only have the means to smile left!</p>
<p class="p1">What joy would that be.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What bliss this</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spiritual</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theft.</p>
